# Employee Tracker

This is a command-line human resources management system incorporating node, inquirer, MySQL and console.table.

The user is prompted for which operation they would like to perform within the program. The user can do the following:

* View all employees (id, first name, last name, role ID and department ID)
* View all roles (role ID, title, salary and department)
* View all departments (ID and department name)
* Add a new role (title, salary and department)
* Add a new department (name)
* Update an employee's role
* Add a new employee (first name, last name, role ID and department ID)

I tried to use a constructor in a separate file to define all my queries, but ultimately decided to focus on getting a functional application before dividing my code up with a constructor function.
